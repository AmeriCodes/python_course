"""This is a DocString """

"""Docstrings are documentation strings in Python, used to describe objects such as functions, classes, or modules. They can be accessed at runtime and provide detailed information about the usage and behavior of the object.

Comments, on the other hand, are snippets of text added to the code to provide explanations or annotations to programmers. They are ignored by the Python interpreter and have no impact on program execution.

In summary, docstrings are for documentation, accessible at runtime, while comments are for clarification purposes and are ignored by the Python interpreter."""
